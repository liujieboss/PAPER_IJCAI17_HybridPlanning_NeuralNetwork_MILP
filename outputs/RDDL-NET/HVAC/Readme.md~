File Descriptions
===========================

WARNING: The network trained for this problem is optimal, but can be used to test RDDL interface. We may add more features(constants) into training scope.

### Network
Neural Network Weight File

### Network Normalization
Normalize data before feeding in the network

### Headers
Node ID with corresponding state name and terms

### Interm_Distribution
Network intermediate output distribution: mean and std

### Data and Label
The data and label that used to train the network, maybe useful to check

### Reservoir_det
This is determinized reservoir description file in RDDL. Please use this file to write the reward function.
